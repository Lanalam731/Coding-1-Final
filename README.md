# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for F2020 Coding 1
My website for my Coding I final is about my dog Ace! I wanted to make it about Ace because I really love him. On every page, I created my own personal logo for bonus points. The logo has the text “Lana’s Dog Ace”. On the homepage, there is a photo of Ace. On the About page, there is another picture of him. There is also a short paragraph about Ace. The paragraph is just a short description of him, such as his likes and breed. On the Contact page is my contact information such as my phone number and email. To contact Ace, you have to contact me, the owner! And finally, in the footer is the live link. Throughout the website, I use the color green. I use green in the logo and background color of the entire body. I used green because that is the color of the collar Ace uses now. Because of that, I thought it would suit the website.
